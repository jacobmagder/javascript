Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes and classes. It also supports functional programming since functions are first-class objects that can be easily created via expressions and passed around like any other object.\n\nThis page serves as a quick overview of various JavaScript language features, written for readers with background in other languages, such as C or Java.\n\nLet's start off by looking at the building blocks of any language: the types. JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type. JavaScript offers seven primitive types:",

      "title": "Inheritance and the prototype chain",
      "description": "In programming, inheritance refers to passing down characteristics from a parent to a child so that a new piece of code can reuse and build upon the features of an existing one. JavaScript implements inheritance by using objects. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype and acts as the final link in this prototype chain. It is possible to mutate any member of the prototype chain or even swap out the prototype at runtime, so concepts like static dispatching do not exist in JavaScript.\n\nJavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does not have static types. While this confusion is often considered to be one of JavaScript's weaknesses, the prototypal inheritance model itself is, in fact, more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypal model \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is how classes are implemented.\n\nAlthough classes are now widely adopted and have become a new paradigm in JavaScript, classes do not bring a new inheritance pattern. While classes abstract most of the prototypal mechanism away, understanding how prototypes work under the hood is still useful.",

In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.\n\nConsider the following example code:\n\ninit() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName(). The displayName() function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and is available only within the body of the init() function. Note that the displayName() function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer scopes, displayName() can access the variable name declared in the parent function, init().",

Some input elements are insignificant to the interpreter, and will be stripped after this step \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they include white space and comments. The others, including identifiers, keywords, literals, and punctuators (mostly operators), will be used for further syntax analysis. Line terminators and multiline comments are also syntactically insignificant, but they guide the process for automatic semicolons insertion to make certain invalid token sequences become valid.\n\nFormat-control characters have no visual representation but are used to control the interpretation of the text.\n\nIn JavaScript source text, <ZWNJ> and <ZWJ> are treated as identifier parts, while <BOM> (also called a zero-width no-break space <ZWNBSP> when not at the start of text) is treated as white space.",

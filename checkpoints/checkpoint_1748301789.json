A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.\n\nObjects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.\n\nIn addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

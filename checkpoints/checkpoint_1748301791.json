In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.\n\nIn addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

In this section, we will demonstrate how objects can be created from classes.\n\nIn many other languages, classes, or constructors, are clearly distinguished from objects, or instances. In JavaScript, classes are mainly an abstraction over the existing prototypical inheritance mechanism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all patterns are convertible to prototype-based inheritance. Classes themselves are normal JavaScript values as well, and have their own prototype chains. In fact, most plain JavaScript functions can be used as constructors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you use the new operator with a constructor function to create a new object.\n\nWe will be playing with the well-abstracted class model in this tutorial, and discuss what semantics classes offer.

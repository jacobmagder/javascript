Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes and classes. It also supports functional programming since functions are first-class objects that can be easily created via expressions and passed around like any other object.\n\nThis page serves as a quick overview of various JavaScript language features, written for readers with background in other languages, such as C or Java.\n\nLet's start off by looking at the building blocks of any language: the types. JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type. JavaScript offers seven primitive types:",

      "title": "Inheritance and the prototype chain",
      "description": "In programming, inheritance refers to passing down characteristics from a parent to a child so that a new piece of code can reuse and build upon the features of an existing one. JavaScript implements inheritance by using objects. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype and acts as the final link in this prototype chain. It is possible to mutate any member of the prototype chain or even swap out the prototype at runtime, so concepts like static dispatching do not exist in JavaScript.\n\nJavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does not have static types. While this confusion is often considered to be one of JavaScript's weaknesses, the prototypal inheritance model itself is, in fact, more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypal model \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is how classes are implemented.\n\nAlthough classes are now widely adopted and have become a new paradigm in JavaScript, classes do not bring a new inheritance pattern. While classes abstract most of the prototypal mechanism away, understanding how prototypes work under the hood is still useful.",

In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.\n\nConsider the following example code:\n\ninit() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName(). The displayName() function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and is available only within the body of the init() function. Note that the displayName() function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer scopes, displayName() can access the variable name declared in the parent function, init().",

Possible values are:\n\n\"sort\" (default)\n\nFor sorting a list of strings.\n\n\"search\"\n\nFor filtering a list of strings by testing each list item for a full-string match against a key. With \"search\", the caller should only pay attention to whether compare() returns zero or non-zero and should not distinguish the non-zero return values from each other. That is, it is inappropriate to use \"search\" for sorting/ordering.\n\n\n\nlocaleMatcher\n\nThe locale matching algorithm to use. Possible values are \"lookup\" and \"best fit\"; the default is \"best fit\". For information about this option, see Locale identification and negotiation.\n\ncollation\n\nVariant collations for certain locales, such as \"emoji\", \"pinyin\", \"stroke\", and so on. Only has an effect when usage is \"sort\" (because \"search\" is underlyingly its own collation type). For a list of supported collation types, see Intl.supportedValuesOf(); the default is \"default\". This option can also be set through the co Unicode extension key; if both are provided, this options property takes precedence.\n\nnumeric\n\nWhether numeric collation should be used, such that \"1\" < \"2\" < \"10\". Possible values are true and false; the default is false. This option can also be set through the kn Unicode extension key; if both are provided, this options property takes precedence.\n\ncaseFirst\n\nWhether upper case or lower case should sort first. Possible values are \"upper\", \"lower\", and \"false\" (use the locale's default); the default is \"false\". This option can also be set through the kf Unicode extension key; if both are provided, this options property takes precedence.\n\nsensitivity\n\nWhich differences in the strings should lead to non-zero result values. Possible values are:\n\n\"base\"\n\nOnly strings that differ in base letters compare as unequal. Examples: a \u00e2\u0089\u00a0 b, a = \u00c3\u00a1, a = A. In the Unicode collation algorithm, this is equivalent to the primary strength level.\n\n\"accent\"\n\nOnly strings that differ in base letters or accents and other diacritic marks compare as unequal.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been available across browsers since September 2015.\n\nTemplate literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates.\n\nTemplate literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.",
